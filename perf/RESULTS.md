# METIS Bit-Identical Optimization Campaign — Results

Branch: `perf-bit-identical`. Driven by `PERF-REVIEW.md`. Every change here is **bit-identical**
to baseline output (verified: all 10 configs `cmp`-equal to `perf/ref/` for `seed=12345`).

## Method
- Build: `make config cc=gcc-15 && make` (gcc-15, `-O3 -march=native`, single-threaded → deterministic).
- Gate: `perf/harness.sh verify perf/ref` — must show `pass=11 fail=0` (byte-identical output).
- **Two measurement modes, deliberately:**
  - **Per-phase attribution** (`perf/harness.sh bench`): uses **`-dbglvl=2`** to read METIS's
    internal phase timers (coarsen/match/contract/initpart/refine). Used to attribute a change
    to the phase it touches. NOTE: `-dbglvl=2` adds timer-call overhead that **inflates ndmetis
    totals ~2×** (1.4s real → ~2.9s timed) because the per-phase timers fire thousands of times
    in the deep dissection recursion; treat harness *totals* as relative-only, especially for nd.
  - **Headline speedup** (`perf/compare.sh`): runs with **NO `-dbglvl` flag, i.e. dbglvl=0**
    (the program default, confirmed at programs/cmdline_*.c), so there is zero timer overhead.
    This is an **interleaved A/B**: baseline binary and current binary alternated per repeat so
    machine-state drift hits both equally; min-of-N of the program's own `(METIS time)` line.
    **All headline % figures below are dbglvl=0.**
- **Memory** (`perf/mem.sh`, dbglvl=0): METIS's gk-tracked heap high-water (`Max memory used`,
  printed even at dbglvl=0) plus OS max RSS via `/usr/bin/time -l` as a ground-truth cross-check.
- Machine: Apple Silicon (10 cores), Darwin 25.5.0. Runs serial, machine otherwise idle.
- Raw rows accumulate in `perf/RESULTS.tsv`.

## Optimizations (each verified bit-identical before measuring)

| ID | Description | Status | Key effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2.2 | Delete dead cmap stores in matching | ✅ bit-identical | matching −5..6% (cit) |
| T2.6 | SHEM condition reorder | ✅ bit-identical | matching −4..15% more (cit) |
| T2.8 | MMDOrder dead restore pass | ✅ bit-identical | nd neutral (noise) on mdual |
| T2.1 | Contraction hash-probe (htkeys) | ❌ REVERTED | contract +8% regression on ARM (extra store/cache pressure; removed load was already hot) |
| T2.3 | Fuse rename into split extraction | ✅ bit-identical | neutral on matrix (split phase tiny here; payoff is large recursive bisection) |
| T2.5 | cnbrpool presizing | ❌ REVERTED | speed-neutral but +7–8% (cit) / +25% (mdual) PEAK MEMORY — bad trade |
| T2.7 | sqrt table (gain priority) | wip | kway refine |
| T2.9 | CompressGraph early abort | ✅ bit-identical | exercised on mdual (rejected); nd front-end saving sub-noise |
| T2.4 | Reuse 2-way FM pqueues across calls | ❌ REVERTED | bit-identical but neutral (alloc churn sub-noise, like T2.5); not worth persistent-state complexity |
| T2.10 | SoA cnbr_t pool | ⏸ DEFERRED | see rationale below |
| T3.1 | LTO (CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION) | ✅ bit-identical KEPT | broad small gain; standard zero-risk |

### Outcome summary
**Kept (7):** T2.2, T2.6 (matching −10..20% on cit), T2.7 (k-way refine −6..7% on cit
50/100), T3.1 LTO (broad small), and T2.3/T2.8/T2.9 (bit-identical, correct, remove
proven work, neutral-but-trivial on this matrix). Net **~3.5–4% on k-way cit-Patents**
and rb_mdual — all bit-identical, and **peak memory identical to baseline** (see memory
section). The only kept opt that allocates anything new is T2.7 (+~1 KB sqrt table).

**Reverted (3), benchmarking-guided:**
- **T2.1** (contraction htkeys): measured **+8% contraction regression** — the removed
  `cadjncy[htable[kk]]` load was already hot, and the parallel `htkeys[]` added a store +
  cache pressure. Apple-Silicon OoO hid the original dependent-load latency.
- **T2.4** (FM queue reuse): **neutral** — the `rpqCreate` O(nvtxs) locator init it removes
  is sub-noise vs the FM work; not worth the persistent ctrl-queue state.
- **T2.5** (cnbrpool presizing): speed-**neutral** but **+6.7–8.5% peak memory on cit-Patents
  (+101–130 MB) and +24–25% on mdual (+7 MB)** — see memory section. Front-loading the full
  `graph->nedges` pool (264 MB on cit) makes it resident alongside the entire coarsening
  hierarchy, instead of growing lazily as coarse graphs are freed. Neutral speed + real
  memory cost = bad trade. (Caught only because memory was measured — initially mis-kept as
  "neutral, removes churn.")

**Deferred (1): T2.10 SoA cnbr_t.** Splitting `cnbr_t{pid,ed}` into parallel `pid[]/ed[]`
arrays touches struct.h, wspace.c, kwayfm.c, kwayrefine.c, macros.h, contig.c, minconn.c —
a large refactor of the hottest refinement loop with high bit-identical risk. Its mechanism
(cache-line efficiency of pid-only scans) is the same class as T2.1, which **measurably
regressed** on this wide-OoO/large-cache target; and the ed[] value is consumed right after
the pid in the gain computation, so both arrays are touched per entry anyway. Expected
benefit on this hardware ≈ 0; risk high. Recommend implementing only behind a profiler on a
cache-bound target (e.g. older x86, or i64/r64 builds where cnbr_t is wider). Not done to
avoid destabilizing the verified working set for predicted-zero gain.

### Key lesson (Apple Silicon, gcc-15 -O3 -march=native -arch arm64)
Opts that remove **actual redundant work** (dead stores T2.2, the SHEM cache-miss skip T2.6)
or **expensive ops on the critical path** (sqrt T2.7) win. Opts that merely trade compute
for memory or rearrange allocation/layout (T2.1, T2.4, T2.5) are neutral-or-worse here — the
wide out-of-order core with large caches already hides the latencies they target.

## Cumulative SPEED result — interleaved A/B at dbglvl=0, baseline vs current (FINAL)

`perf/compare.sh` min-of-5, **dbglvl=0** (no timer overhead), baseline and current alternated
per repeat to cancel machine drift. Baseline = master (no opts, no LTO). Current = final kept
set (T2.2, T2.3, T2.6, T2.7, T2.8, T2.9, T3.1; after reverting T2.1/T2.4/T2.5).

| config | baseline s | current s | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| kway_cit_10 | 8.022 | 7.699 | **-4.0%** |
| kway_cit_50 | 10.994 | 10.595 | **-3.6%** |
| kway_cit_100 | 13.529 | 13.060 | **-3.5%** |
| kway_mdual_10 | 0.062 | 0.062 | +0.0% (noise) |
| kway_mdual_50 | 0.080 | 0.080 | +0.0% (noise) |
| kway_mdual_100 | 0.118 | 0.120 | +1.7% (noise) |
| rb_mdual_10 | 0.174 | 0.170 | -2.3% |
| rb_mdual_50 | 0.288 | 0.280 | -2.8% |
| rb_mdual_100 | 0.347 | 0.335 | -3.5% |
| nd_mdual | 1.441 | 1.410 | -2.2% |
| nd_mdual_cc | 1.530 | 1.510 | -1.3% |

Net: **~3.5–4% faster on k-way cit-Patents** (the most stable read; cit_100 = -3.5% in two
independent sessions), **rb_mdual -2.3..-3.5%**, **nd -1.3..-2.2%**. mdual k-way is
0.06–0.12 s, so its matching win is sub-millisecond and shows as noise (±). Driven by matching
(T2.2/T2.6) and k-way refine (T2.7); LTO contributes a small, broad amount. All bit-identical.

> An earlier interleaved run (pre-T2.5-revert) read cit -5.4/-4.4/-3.5%; the difference vs the
> -4.0/-3.6/-3.5% above is inter-session baseline drift (that run's baseline was 7.825 vs 8.022
> here). cit_100 = -3.5% is stable across both. Removing T2.5 did **not** reduce speed.

## Cumulative MEMORY result — A/B at dbglvl=0, baseline vs current (FINAL)

`perf/mem.sh`, dbglvl=0. **heap** = METIS gk-tracked high-water (`Max memory used`,
deterministic); **RSS** = OS max resident set via `/usr/bin/time -l` (single-shot, noisy —
includes the 265 MB graph read + page cache). The deterministic heap number is authoritative.

| config | base heap MB | cur heap MB | heap delta | base RSS | cur RSS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| kway_cit_10 | 1520.762 | 1520.763 | +0.0% | 1977.0 | 1975.5 |
| kway_cit_100 | 1527.885 | 1527.886 | +0.0% | 1884.8 | 1861.9 |
| kway_mdual_10 | 29.251 | 29.251 | +0.0% | 51.5 | 50.8 |
| kway_mdual_100 | 29.287 | 29.287 | +0.0% | 50.7 | 50.4 |
| rb_mdual_100 | 28.992 | 28.992 | +0.0% | 52.7 | 66.1* |
| nd_mdual | 29.972 | 29.972 | +0.0% | 66.7 | 59.8* |

**Peak heap is identical to baseline on every config** (the +0.001 MB on cit is T2.7's
`cnbrsqrt` table: `(nparts+1)·8` bytes ≈ 0.8 KB at 100 parts). The kept opts otherwise only
*remove* work or reorder code — no new allocations. (*RSS entries marked `*` are single-shot
variance: gk-heap is byte-identical there, so the swing is page-cache/measurement noise, not a
real regression.)

### Per-kept-opt memory impact
| opt | memory delta |
|---|---|
| T2.2, T2.6, T2.8 | 0 (delete stores/passes; no allocation) |
| T2.3 | 0 (removes a pass; allocations unchanged) |
| T2.9 | 0 (early loop exit; allocations unchanged) |
| T3.1 (LTO) | 0 at runtime (compiler flag) |
| T2.7 | +`(nparts+1)·sizeof(double)` ≈ **0.8 KB** at 100 parts (per refinement workspace) |

Conclusion: the final kept set buys ~3.5–4% on the main k-way/rb workloads **at zero peak-memory
cost**. The only memory-increasing candidate (T2.5) was reverted precisely because its cost was
not justified by any speedup.

### Measurement caveats discovered
- **`-dbglvl=2` doubles ndmetis time** (1.4 s true vs 2.9 s timed): per-phase
  `gk_startcputimer` calls fire thousands of times across the deep dissection recursion. The
  harness phase tables (dbglvl=2) are inflated for nd; the headline figures use dbglvl=0
  (`compare.sh`) and are clean.
- cit-Patents *totals* drift ~5–8% run-to-run with machine state; the reliable reads are
  per-phase isolation (judge an opt by the column it touches) and interleaved A/B at dbglvl=0.
- **Single-shot RSS is noisy**; the gk-tracked heap high-water is deterministic and is the
  authoritative peak-memory number.
